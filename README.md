# nosql-challenge
I used this line of text to import the data from Terminal: `mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json
The file "NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb is to set up the database and Jupyter Notebook, and to update the database
The file "NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb is to do an analysis on the updated database that was done earlier. 
In this analysis, I was able to answer the following questions: 1) Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?, 2)Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?, 3)What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?, 4) How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
The Resources folder contains the establishments.json file.
